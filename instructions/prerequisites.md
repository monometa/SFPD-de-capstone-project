## Prerequisites

The following requirements are needed to reproduce the project:

1. A [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account.
2. (Optional) The [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk). Instructions for installing it are below.
    * Most instructions below will assume that you are using the SDK for simplicity.
    * If you use a VM instance on Google Cloud Platform the Google Cloud SDK comes installed by default, don't have to perform this step.
3. (Optional) A SSH client.
    * All the instructions listed below assume that you are using a Terminal and SSH.
4. (Optional) VSCode with the Remote-SSH extension.
    * Any other IDE should work, but VSCode makes it very convenient to forward ports in remote VM's.
5. A [DBT cloud account](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/) and connect to your BigQuery [following these instructions](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_4_analytics_engineering/dbt_cloud_setup.md).

Development and testing were carried out using a Google Cloud Compute VM instance. Strongly recommend that a VM instance is used for reproducing the project as well. All the instructions below will assume that a VM is used.
